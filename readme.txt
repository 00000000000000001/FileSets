How it works:

- choose a single file or a directory
- single files file or directory will be treated as a set of files
- there will be no duplicates in a set
- you can apply a set expression to your sets
- operators are: + (union), & (intersect), - (subtract)
- you can use round brackets as well
- if you click the export button the files of your result set will be 
exportet into 
"Export" in the application directory
