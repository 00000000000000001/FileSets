How it works:

- choose a directory
- files in directories will be treated as elements of a set. So there will be no duplicates in a set.
- you can apply a set expression to your sets
- operators are: + (union), & (intersect), - (subtract)
- expression tokens need to be separated by spaces (e.g. "A + B", not 
"A+B")
- you can use round brackets as well
- if you click the export button the files of your result set will be 
exportet into "Export" in the application directory

What is it good for?

- eleminate file duplicates
- analyse directories for similarities or differences
